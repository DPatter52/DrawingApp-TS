# Overview

This is a small TypeScript project to help highlight some basic principles of the language. 

This program is a drawing app that has a few basic functions like being able to draw using a pen, rectangle, and circle tools. 
You can also customize the size of the pen tool and the color of the various tools. When you're done drawing, you can also erase
the canvas to start all over again!

Outside of programming, I'm really into art and drawing of all kinds. I also grew up using Microsoft Paint and I wanted to do
something similar at some point in my coding career. I decided to use typescript, thinking that it would be fairly easy to get the different aspects
of this program working that I wanted because of how modular it is, and it ended up working well with what I had in my head.
